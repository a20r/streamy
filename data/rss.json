He called her a \"lovely woman who was one of the few truly good people\".The family won acclaim throughout Europe for their singing and escaped from Nazi-occupied Austria in 1938. Their story was turned into the film and Broadway musical. Maria von Trapp was the third child and second-oldest daughter of Austrian naval captain Georg von Trapp and his first wife, Agathe Whitehead von Trapp. Their seven children were the basis for the singing family in the 1959 Broadway musical and 1965 film, which won the Oscar for best picture. Maria von Trapp was portrayed as Louisa in the film (played by Heather Menzies) and musical.The Sound of Music was based loosely on a 1949 book by Georg von Trapp's second wife, also Maria von Trapp, who died in 1987. It tells the story of an Austrian woman who married a widower with seven children and taught them music.In 1938, the family escaped from Nazi-occupied Austria. After they arrived in New York, the family became popular with concert audiences. The family eventually settled in Vermont, where they opened a ski lodge in Stowe.Maria von Trapp played accordion and taught Austrian dance with her sister Rosmarie at the lodge.She wrote in a biography posted on the Von Trapp family's website that she was born in the Austrian Alps after her family fled fighting from the first world war and that she was surrounded by music growing up.\"Father played the violin, accordion and mandolin. Mother played piano and violin,\" she wrote. \"I have fond memories of our grandmother playing the piano for us after meals.\"Her biography on the website also said that she worked as a lay missionary in Papua New Guinea.Rosmarie von Trapp, Johannes von Trapp and Eleonore Von Trapp Campbell were born to Georg von Trapp and Maria von Trapp.AustriaEuropetheguardian.com &copy; 2014 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"The SNP's proposal to allow state guardians to be named for every child in Scotland is interfering and unhelpfulThe SNP's disturbing, seven-year obsession with looking through the nation's keyholes to ensure we are all behaving, sitting straight, eating properly and getting to bed early continues. It is surely only a matter of time before the Scottish government's children's minister, Aileen Campbell, is invited to North Korea to make a presentation on how her party has managed to secure such coast-to-coast state surveillance of families without any bad publicity.Last Wednesday night, the government effectively paved the way for official surveillance of family life by allowing for state guardians to be appointed for every child in Scotland. The move is part of the SNP's otherwise sound and thoughtful children and young people bill, which also guarantees free school meals for children in primary year one to three and a significant increase in nursery provision. This interventionist, hand-wringing party of state busybodies simply cannot help itself, though, and they ruined the tenor of the legislation with their state guardians.According to them, this is a benign move that will assign a named person to every child from birth until the age of 18. If said named person has any concerns about a child's welfare, they may be able to refer the case to social workers. Before that, though, the named person will be able to access information about a child and his family from the police and health authorities. The government says that families are not required to accept advice or offers of help from the named person. \"Any actions or advice from the named person must be fair, proportionate and respect rights with the aim of safeguarding the wellbeing of the child,\" the government says.It adds that the guardians will be chosen from among existing teachers and healthcare professionals and will be people who may already exist in a child's life. So effectively, they are being encouraged to go further by being given extra powers. This, as with much of what passes for the SNP's social agenda, is meaningless and incoherent. In reality, any poor family that does indeed reject intervention of the state busybody will soon be receiving a visit from the plods and an army of social workers.There is a formidable array of agencies, both formal and informal, which protects children from abuse and neglect. These are designed to receive and pass on early warnings about a child's welfare. This is a list of them; you might recognise most of them: the immediate family; relatives of immediate family; friends; neighbours; teachers; doctors; health visitors; the police; social workers; charities that specialise in child welfare issues. Also, the proposals could lead, bizarrely, to a situation where there could be different named people for different children in the family. This seems in contrast to the GIRFEC (getting it right for every child) model of sharing information and could leave scope for things to be missed.So why does the Scottish government seek to impose another layer of watchmen upon the nation's families? The first reason is because it seems programmed to seek control of every aspect of the lives of its citizens. Aided and abetted by an increasingly out-of-control police force it has already sought to criminalise young people from poor neighbourhoods for singing political songs that the Scottish state deems unacceptable. It has tried to ban Buckfast; prevent the use of glasses in pubs and banish happy hours. It wants to examine our fridges and ban smoking in cars. The Scottish government, aided and abetted by a nonexistent opposition, will not stop until surveillance cameras are installed in every home.The second reason is that the government simply don't trust poor people and those who live in our edgier neighbourhoods to bring up their children according to the Mumsnet way. The people who face social challenges every day in their lives simply do not have enough time to organise cupcake demonstrations or have online discussions on how to get the best out of a blowjob.Sometimes, they shout at their children in supermarkets and the rest of us look on meaningfully, wishing we could intervene but fearing a good slap if we did. Warning signs of neglect or worse may not be warning signs at all, but merely the behavioural consequences of living in extreme deprivation.What these people do not need is another well-meaning, middle-class, professional nanny peering into their lives. I'll be surprised if this piece of legislative suburban junk isn't deemed contrary to article 12 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights: \"No one shall be subjected to arbitrary interference with his privacy, family, home or correspondence, nor to attacks upon his honour and reputation. Everyone has the right to the protection of the law against such interference or attacks.\"If it is somehow allowed to become law, then we all know what the consequences will be: many more working-class people will be held to be guilty of something unstated and inferred. In several cases, innocent families will be pulled apart simply on the whim of a government that doesn't know when to stop and that wants us to sign up to its \"one-size-fits-all\" model of family life. Soon, they will be designing the family and telling us how big it ought to be (according to postcode, of course).Unaccountably, some of the bigger children's charities, including those that are handsomely paid by government, have no problem with this. There is a reason for this; many of the organisations in this sector, while doing great work in research and teaching, have simply forgotten – or don't want to know – what daily challenges are faced by poor, single mothers (and some fathers) in rearing children.Here I must declare an interest. I help with a charity, With Kids, which operates in Glasgow's East End and Edinburgh's Wester Hailes and that works closely with schools to help children and families who may be encountering an array of social challenges in their lives through no fault of their own. Many of our therapists are disturbed at the implications of this shallow and ill-conceived proposal. They are part of a dynamic network of care and community values that encompasses many very good people and overworked agencies. When it works, as it often does against the odds, the results can be beautiful and uplifting.The Scottish government last week just tried to make their jobs a lot harder.ChildrenScottish National party (SNP)PovertySocial exclusionSurveillanceScotlandKevin McKennatheguardian.com &copy; 2014 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"Larkin's", "having", "others", "Emily" ], "summary" : "New Vic, Newcastle-under-Lyme; Crucible, Sheffield; Lyttelton, LondonDramatic irony proves deeply affecting as the domestic and the epic meet in the lives of Lancashire folk in August 1914An almost empty stage: the edge of a moor suggested by fragments of stone wall; an interior indicated by table and chairs. From next to nothing a world appears. August 1914, the north-west of England, an industrial community (livelihoods depending on the textile mills) is preparing its annual summer celebration. A lad paints a banner for the Rushcart festival. The \"Squire\" of the morris men flies into a fury because the flowers he's been growing to decorate his hat on the big day have been eaten by neighbour JU's escaped chickens – they haven't spoken since the last time she let them get away, three years ago. The Squire's daughter is secretly walking out with JU's son. He is a brilliant but dangerously innovative dancer (\"There's no call for artistic expression!\"), too scared to ask Squire's permission to court his daughter.Local gossip and squabbles about whether women should be allowed to join the dance (in smaller and larger senses) are interspersed with snippets of further-off affairs: recruiting bands are playing in nearby towns – \"Arthur Barraclough's taken the shilling!\" The young men's eyes shine. We know, as the characters do not, that this war will not be An August Bank Holiday Lark (the title is taken from a line in Philip Larkin's poem MCMXIV). Even as the life of the community unfurls vividly before us, it is ripped to shreds: the young men leave to fight, the women take over their work and the world changes irrevocably.Writer Deborah McAndrew uses the audience's knowledge of events to add texture to this deceptively simple script. It's a potentially dangerous tactic: dramatic irony is cloying if overused. McAndrew avoids this by skilfully interweaving three time strands: the linear time lived by the community on the stage, the vertical time of history and the cyclical time of seasons and rituals. The result is simultaneously domestic and epic: events in a particular place and time become the expression of universal experience of the effects of war. It is deeply affecting.An August Bank Holiday Lark is McAndrew's fifth piece for Northern Broadsides. It's Broadsides' sixth co-production with the New Vic (set and costumes by their resident designer, Lis Evans). Artistic director Barrie Rutter dreamed up the brief for the piece, which he directs, and in which he delivers a truly outstanding performance as the Squire (fury, grief, joy, desolation – all breathtakingly intense). Resident director Conrad Nelson weaves music and choreography seamlessly into the action. Four of the 12-strong cast have performed with the company before; all sing, dance (complicated morris footwork and patterns), play instruments and portray convincing, textured, multilayered characters (special mentions for Darren Kuppan and Emily Butterfield as the courting couple, and Mark Thomas making his first professional appearance). This is popular ensemble theatre in traditions stretching from Molière to Meyerhold and beyond: vibrant, entertaining and meaningful.Brian Friel's 1980 Translations also uses the audience's awareness of history, but his format is that of a \"thesis play\". He sets up an idea and works through it by way of situation and characters (Ben Jonson-ish to Northern Broadsides's Shakespeare-ish). Here, in this Sheffield, English Touring and Rose Kingston theatres co-production, community tradition is revealed not through songs and dances, but in names and language. It's 1833 and the British army is mapping Ireland in order better to administer the country (ie, more efficiently collect taxes). Part of the exercise involves replacing \"incomprehensible\" Gaelic place names with others easier for anglophone ears and tongues (further rationalisation will establish compulsory schooling, available only in English).Questions raised by the text – around ideas of colonisation as domination; identity as an individual and collective construct; civilisation as a shifting term depending on viewpoint – stand out clearly in James Grieve's production. The setting is stark. In the background stands a realistic barn/home of rough stone, with wooden stairs clinging to its side; before it stretches the playing area, wide and deep and charcoal grey (Lucy Osborne's design). This is the site of a \"hedge school\" where \"the Master\" (a roaring tour de force from Niall Buggy) and his younger son instruct local youths and adults in Homer's Greek, times tables and everything in between. Normal life is interrupted by the arrival of a British captain, his lieutenant and their translator – elder son of the Master – and (offstage) troops.Grieve plots the movements of his actors with precision. He makes sure that each character strongly conveys the idea they represent (James Northcote's corporal with his Tiggerishly energetic – bounding into the air – naive enthusiasm for all things Irish, and growing attraction for Máire, for instance; Beth Cooke's Máire, expressing her longing for a wider world of possibilities). The device of having Irish-speakers and English-speakers failing to understand one another while all speaking English succeeds beautifully.What was lacking was the emotional intensity of, for instance, the National Theatre's 2004 touring version, directed by Sean Holmes. Without it, the situation is more interesting than engrossing, the&nbsp;ideas less urgently compelling. This&nbsp;coolly intelligent production promises deepening complexity as the run develops.The National Theatre's new production of Shelagh Delaney's 1958 hit A Taste of Honey is a puzzle. In the first place: why do it? It was attention-grabbing when Joan Littlewood produced it at Stratford East in 1958: written by a little-educated Salford teenager – and a girl, at that; featuring a flighty, sexually active single mother; interracial, underage sex; pregnancy; intimations of paedophilia, homosexuality and, perhaps most shocking of all, a working-class, northern setting. It's a lively script, but now that TV soaps regularly cover all these issues it seems less satisfying as a stage drama. A revival makes us look back in wonder at the parochialism of the mid-20th century London theatre that found it so extraordinary.In the second place: if you are going to do it, why do it like this? A production by Jo Combes at Manchester Royal Exchange in 2008 communicated the strengths of the play by precisely unpicking the layers of emotion striating mother and daughter's fraught relationship. Here, under Bijan Sheibani's direction, the emphasis is heavily on comedy; at times, it seems, anything goes, so long as it raises a laugh. This plays oddly against Hildegard Bechtler's set of dreary streets, distant gas tower and squalid sitting room; its close attention to realistic detail contrasts with the artificiality of the actors' cartoon-style movement. Lesley Sharp as the mother is most extreme – hips heading one way, shoulders another, head jabbing on an alternative plane.This would be terrific in a Restoration comedy; here, it constrains the character. It's as if the director doesn't trust the play to be interesting without extreme exaggeration. And yet there are terrific moments – Sharp, again, in stricken moments showing the horror beneath the mother's mask of self-interested insouciance; the scenes between Kate O'Flynn as her teenage, pregnant daughter and Harry Hepple as the diffident gay friend. These suggest there's more to Sheibani's vision than is currently realised in a production struggling to free itself from an over-ponderous concept.Star ratings (out of 5)An August Bank Holiday Lark *****Translations ****A Taste of Honey *** TheatreNational TheatreShelagh DelaneyFirst world warIrelandClare Brennantheguardian.com &copy; 2014 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

But diplomats says she is unlikely to support a reopening of EU treaties that could allow large-scale \"repatriation\" of powers of the kind demanded by many Tory Eurosceptics.Downing Street appears to have accepted that talk of \"repatriation\" of powers may be unrealistic and a focus on rule changes within the existing treaty framework may be more realistic. Sources say Merkel's view is that, while she wants to help Cameron, the more urgent task for Berlin is to create a more stable and lasting framework for the euro, rather than reopening the entire EU treaty rulebook.While the Ukrainian crisis is likely to take up much of the two leaders' time, the EU elections and appointments to the soon-to-be-vacant posts of European commission president, president of the parliament, and president of the council are likely to be raised.Both leaders are alarmed at attempts by the European parliament to seize control of the decision as to who the next president of the commission should be. Cameron is concerned elements in the parliament are pushing the German Social Democrat Martin Schulz to be commission president.Former Tory minister John Redwood said on Saturday night he would like Cameron to raise the need for cheaper energy and make clear, tactfully, how British people felt about the EU. \"I don't think he should threaten her in any way, but the reality is very simple: either we get a new relationship that makes sense for Britain, or the British people will vote to leave,\" he said.Stewart Jackson, Conservative MP for Peterborough, added: \"The prime minister needs to make it quite clear to Mrs Merkel that the era of ever-closer union moving towards a federal European superstate is over.\"We are serious about fundamental renegotiation on issues like free movement and benefit tourism and the Germans must understand that the British electorate will soon have options before it, which may mean an exit from the EU.

"joining", "independent.", "having" ], "summary" : "As David Cameron and his cabinet arrive in Aberdeen, Alex Salmond is rallying his SNP party for a major battle to win hearts and mindsIn Aberdeen on a cold Friday afternoon, they are weighing up the idea of divorce. It is now just over six months until Scots have to make their decision on independence. Opinion is split among shoppers trudging through the city's windswept streets. Some can't wait to cut loose and be free after 307 years.Shop worker Marian Forbes, leaning into a stiff breeze on Union Street , abhors the \"condescension of the English\". She even viewed David Bowie's intervention in the independence debate last week, when the singer called on Scots to \"stay with us\", as part of a Westminster plot.\"The problem is that since the battle of Culloden the English think they own us,\" she said. \"They'll do anything, use all sorts of dirty tricks, to keep us under their thumb. Cameron is putting a lot of us off with his moves.\"But Bill Kelman, a 65-year-old approaching retirement, takes the opposite view. After Gordon Brown's warning last week that Kelman's pension would be affected by independence, his mind is made up: \"I'm totally on for staying in the UK. I can't even contemplate, never mind risk, losing my state pension.\"In the Granite City, which is dependent on oil, more seem in favour of staying together than going it alone. In the gloom of Aitches ale house, a favourite watering hole for oilmen coming ashore after working on the North Sea rigs, the barman spoke for well-paid customers who want things to stay the way they are: \" It's all no in here, mate. It better be anyway.\"On Monday Aberdeen will find itself centre stage in the independence debate when David Cameron leads his entire cabinet to this corner of Scotland to symbolise his government's commitment to the union. He will pledge to back investment in North Sea oil and gas and suggest that if Scotland leaves the UK the industries that provide so many jobs might not be so strong. Not wishing to be outdone, Alex Salmond will stage an SNP gathering not far away, arguing the precise opposite.Scots await Cameron and his cabinet with mixed feelings. Glaswegian financial adviser Omar Choudry, 30, in Aberdeen visiting friends, said: \"He's got guts coming up here, I'll give him that. Most of my peer group are pro-UK, with fears over the EU being the biggest point and the currency issue is a clincher. If it's not broke, don't fix it.\"However, haulier Andy Tennant, 42, said that the Conservatives' warnings had already antagonised people like him so much that they had switched to Salmond. \"It's just got my back up. We need a proper debate. If they [Westminster]want to try to scare or bully us, then that is a massive turnoff, not just for me I bet.\"For the past fortnight Scots have heard little but dark warnings from Westminster – and Brussels – about the cost of a yes vote on 18 September. Tentative signs that the yes campaign might just be closing the gap on the no team in opinion polls stirred the pro-union forces into action.First came publication of a letter from Sir Nicholas Macpherson, permanent secretary to the Treasury, to the chancellor, George Osborne, on 11 February. The top mandarin spelt out why a currency union between an independent Scotland and what would be left of the UK would be, in his words, \"fraught with difficulty\".His arguments were many and colourfully put for a civil servant: \"The Scottish government is still leaving the option open of moving to a different currency option in the longer term. Successful currency unions are based on the near universal belief that they are irreversible. Imagine what would have happened to Greece two years ago if they had said they were contemplating reverting to the drachma.\"Two days later, Osborne said Scotland would not be able to carry on using sterling if it became independent. He used an analogy designed to bring the reality home: \"The pound isn't an asset to be divided up between two countries after a breakup like a CD collection.\" Labour and the Liberal Democrats quickly rallied behind the Tory chancellor.Salmond accused the Westminster parties of a combination of bullying and bluff. But then came an arguably even more dramatic warning to those flirting with independence; one from the heart of the EU. European commission president José Manuel Barroso went on television to say it would be \"difficult, if not impossible\" for an independent Scotland to stay inside the European Union.The SNP's official position is that Scotland will be able with no great difficulty to negotiate the terms of its future independent membership of the EU before what it hopes will be Independence Day 24 March 2016, becoming its 29th member state. Then the unionists thought they had scored a populist hit when last Wednesday Bowie sent a message via Kate Moss that he wanted Scotland to \"stay with us\" in the UK as she accepted on his behalf an award as the best British solo artist at the Brit awards.All bad news for the yes campaign? It certainly had the feel of a concerted push, designed to instil fear. But the SNP knows how to fight and found experts with very different views on the currency and EU membership. Former director general of the European commission Jim Currie told members of the Scottish parliament that Barroso was plain wrong: \"I don't think he was correct, and I don't necessarily think that opinion is shared either among all the member states or even necessarily within the commission.\"Salmond predicted that scare stories from London and Brussels would backfire and there was some suggestion he was right when a new poll moved further in the SNP's favour. The gap between the yes and no camps was down to nine points, with yes on 38%, against 47% for the no, according to a Survation survey. The gap had been 20 when Survation asked the question last month.The SNP thinks the polls are moving in its favour, but the unionists believe that on the substantive issues they are on a roll. Scottish lawyers and constitutional experts who have been summoned before committees of the Commons and Lords in Westminster are warning of wider, long-drawn-out uncertainty and constitutional quagmires – including over whether Scotland will be able to negotiate membership of the EU in time for Salmond's Independence Day – in the event of a yes. They warn of nightmarish arguments over oil and the future of shipyards that will drag on for years. Adam Tomkins, the John Millar chair of public law at the University of Glasgow, told the Commons Scottish Affairs Committee recently that the idea that a 307-year-old union can be unpicked so fast – between September this year and March 2016 – is \"risible\", \"preposterous\" and \"ludicrous\". Unionists say the argument cannot really begin in earnest until after the 2015 Westminster elections, leaving impossibly little time.Secretary of state for Scotland Alistair Carmichael told the Observer: \"The SNP's claim is that it will negotiate its way into the EU on the same terms as the UK within 18 months. This is not feasible, especially in the context of seeing how long it has taken other countries joining from outside, such as Croatia or Cyprus, which both took over a decade. No one has done it in less than two years. The timescale on the EU alone is beyond optimistic.\"As the cabinet heads north, the predominant view in Aberdeen seems one of caution amid the competing claims. The city's paper, the Press and Journal, called for people to be wary of leaping into the unknown before they had seen the details. \"People are naturally wary of fundamental change and it goes against the grain to sign up for anything until they have read the small print,\" it said.And a majority of younger Scots seemed pro-union. James Davidson, 21, studying media, said the prospect of Scotland losing its currency was too damaging to contemplate: \"I don't want Alex Salmond to be sole in charge. I don't like David Cameron, but it's nice having the security of the UK.\" Hardly a ringing endorsement for the view from Westminster but, perhaps, a small sign that some of the uncompromising messages being sent north may be filtering through.Scottish independenceDavid CameronAlex SalmondScottish politicsAberdeenScottish National party (SNP)ScotlandEuropean UnionEuropeGeorge OsborneJosé Manuel BarrosoMark TownsendToby Helmtheguardian.com &copy; 2014 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

autocracySeen from the point of view of Vladimir Putin, Moscow's foreign policy of late had been enjoying something of a purple patch. Putin has kept the west at bay over the conflict in Syria for three years and&nbsp;his client Bashar al-Assad in power. Faced&nbsp;with the Russian veto in the Security Council, the doctrine of responsibility to protect and humanitarian interventions has been pushed back.And for a brief period it appeared Russia had pulled off another coup – blocking closer integration of Ukraine and the EU, while pulling that country closer to his envisioned Eurasian Union, the key front in his effort to reunite in a political and economic bloc as much as possible of the former Soviet Union.But as the Winter Olympics in Sochi come to an end today, it cannot be ignored that in his latest machinations in neighbouring Ukraine, Putin appears to have tripped up. His ally, President Yanukovych, whom he had sought to prop up with a deal to provide cheap gas and $15bn in credit, is on the ropes after unleashing lethal force last week against protesters that saw 77 killed.Amid the drama of the last few days, and the whiff of revolution, it is worth voicing caution, however about what the future holds. Ukraine has witnessed revolutionary scenes before that failed to bring much political stability. The recent revolutions of the Arab Spring have shown that stormed palaces, packed squares, absent police and an intoxicating sense of liberation from an old guard do not necessarily deliver better political systems, at least in the short term.What is clear is that the lacklustre support from Moscow for Yanukovych on Friday left him badly exposed, even among supporters of his own Party of Regions, opening the way for his impeachment yesterday. Following the tentative peace deal between the opposition and Yanukovych, the country's parliament delivered a series of humiliating blows to the president, who had already been forced to agree to revert to the 2004 constitution limiting presidential power.In quick order, it approved the sacking of the interior minister who led the brutal crackdown. It ordered reparations, too, for all the injured and ordered the release of Yulia Tymoshenko, the former Ukrainian prime minister and Yanukovych's bitter rival. Among those who voted were members of Yanukovych's own party, boding ill for his prospects. By yesterday afternoon, a special plenary session of parliament had voted by a massive majority to remove Yanukovych, even as the embattled president was in the eastern city of Kharkiv, rallying his support base and accusing his opponents in a televised address of being nationalist \"Nazis\" responsible for a coup.None of which makes the solving of Ukraine's problems any less acute in the months ahead. While much has been made of differences in Ukraine between its Ukrainian-speaking, largely Catholic west and its industrialised, Russian-speaking east, and between the idea that the west looks towards Europe and the east towards Moscow, Ukraine's political discontents are more complex and messy. Anger at the endemic corruption and cronyism, unaffordable gas subsidies and chronic inequalities is not confined to the west and centre. The reality is that what \"pro-Europe\" means in the context of Ukraine's recent political events is not necessarily a concrete or even realistic notion.Instead, it has come to represent a convenient shorthand to encapsulate everything the Yanukovych government is not: embracing ideas such as rule of law; a fairer society where wealth is not simply appropriated by the president's inner circle including his dentist son; political freedoms and legal accountability.It represents a rejection, too, of what was becoming an increasingly autocratic system modelled on Putin's own \"illiberal democracy\" – as some have called it – whose features are kleptocracy, intolerance and a crackdown on protest and freedom of expression.It is perhaps this that was most significant in the deal and parliamentary votes last week – a widespread agreement that those features of the Ukrainian political system most like Putin's Russia should be dismantled.All of which still leaves many risks ahead. A feature of Ukraine's crisis is how protest and violence have become part of a political bargaining process that has seen a cycle of clashes followed by negotiations, purported deals that fall apart and more violence.Most pressing is whether the country can hold together amid declarations yesterday from political figures in both the east and the Crimea that they now represent the government's constitutional legitimacy, and calls in some quarters for the establishment of militias. Equally critical is how Ukraine's mainstream opposition will deal with a newly empowered – if small– hardline nationalist movement, not least Pravy Sektor, whose members were prominent in the fighting in Independence Square and elsewhere and which claims to have armed itself.Another problem is one of leadership. While Tymoshenko's ordered release is to be welcomed, it should also be recalled that the two-time prime minister is a flawed figure whose relentless squabbling with her former Orange Revolution ally and President Viktor Yushchenko opened the way for Yanukovych's election in 2010.Then there is the fundamental issue that Ukraine must negotiate: how a country that has political and trade links with both Europe and with Russia finds a balance between the two forces pulling on it from outside? While the promise of early elections is welcome, they need to be conducted in a less charged atmosphere to avoid more conflict and violence.In part, that will depend on whether Moscow is honest and allows the country's divided electorate to determine its own future. An ominous indication of Moscow's unhappiness with the EU-negotiated deal is be found in the remarks of foreign minister Sergei Lavrov on Saturday afternoon accusing the opposition of being led by \"armed extremists and pogromists\" threatening the country's \"sovereignty.\" A final question is whether Putin's stumble in Ukraine will have any ramifications for him closer to home in a Kremlin that draws lessons for Russia from the fate of the post-Soviet order in Ukraine.Moscow will have been deeply unsettled both by the prominent role played by the troika of EU foreign ministers and by the perceived challenge to Moscow's authority in the region.All of which, taken together, promises fraught months ahead.UkraineViktor YanukovychVladimir PutinRussiaObserver editorialtheguardian.com &copy; 2014 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

It's got more branches than any single bank.\"I think there are around 12,000 parishes; contrast that with an ordinary banking network of just over 1,000 branches or so. The church has a tremendous network on the ground, in the community.\"Developing the church as an alternative source of credit for people who are considered high risk by conventional lenders is a central concern of the archbishop, Justin Welby, who famously declared his intention to \"compete Wonga out of business\".The Church has taken a central role in responding to the rise of the credit companies ,whose sharp practices have alarmed MPs and debt advice experts.In his first interview as chair of the Task Group on Credit Unions and the Financial Sector, Sants said his job was to deliver a plan that is \"action-orientated, not a philosophical debate about credit.\"\"The purpose is to look at how the Church can encourage and facilitate the responsible use of credit and savings.\"There's been a lot of focus on the price of credit and whether credit should be capped, but when you talk to people on the ground who've used payday lenders, the speed of access and the term of the loan are critical. We need to have more of a debate around that.\"Members of the task group include the bishops of Stepney and Hull, representatives of credit unions, and executives with senior level experience in banking and regulation.This summer the Church will launch a credit union for its own employees. Sants indicated this was just the start. \"There is a question of whether that or some other mechanism could provide a service to a wider group.\"Using the church to promote microfinancing initiatives could help small entrepreneurs and community groups seeking credit to help stimulate their local economies.\"We should be giving wide-ranging thought to whether there are helpful business models which the church can bring into play that offer more than just an advice relationship,\" Sants said.AnglicanismPayday loansBorrowing & debtFamily financesJustin WelbyReligionChristianityJamie Dowardtheguardian.com &copy; 2014 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"As Uganda's president remains on the brink of ratifying savage new anti-gay laws, our Africa Correspondent reports on a continent at war with itselfSimon Lokodo cannot imagine kissing a man. \"I think I shall die,\" he said last week. \"I would not exist. It is inhuman. I would be mad. Just imagine eating your faeces.\"Lokodo is \"ethics and integrity\" minister in Uganda and a champion of the country's swingeing anti-homosexuality bill, which looked set to become law on Sunday until President Yoweri Museveni halted it, pending scientific advice. The delay was a small victory for activists dismayed a week ago when Museveni insisted that he would approve the legislation. That news prompted Kenneth Roth, executive director of Human Rights Watch, to tweet: \"In name of Africa culture Uganda Pres will sign anti-gay law pushed by US evangelists toughening British colonial ban.\"In 140 characters, Roth encapsulated a broad sweep of history and geography and one of the central paradoxes of Africa's new war on gay and lesbian people. It is a war marked by political opportunism, biblical fundamentalism and a clash between cultural relativism and universal human rights. But it is also a measure of conservatives' anxiety that every day more and more African homosexuals are coming out and losing their fear. Western liberals eager to see the best in Africa must face an inconvenient truth: this is the most homophobic continent on Earth. Same-sex relations are illegal in 36 of Africa's 55 countries, according to Amnesty International, and punishable by death in some states. Now a fresh crackdown is under way.In January, Nigerian president Goodluck Jonathan signed into law a bill criminalising same-sex \"amorous relationships\" and membership of LGBT rights groups. Last week Gambian president Yahya Jammeh declared: \"We will fight these vermins called homosexuals or gays the same way we are fighting malaria-causing mosquitoes, if not more aggressively.\"This is not, however, merely the hate-filled bile of politicians. They make such statements because they know they will strike a popular chord in swaths of Africa. Anyone who has spent a fair amount of time on the continent is likely to encounter a warm, friendly, decent human being who will stop them short with an outburst of homophobic prejudice. Newspapers, TV and radio often fan the flames.So it is in Uganda, where a tabloid once published photographs of dozens of gay people under the words: \"Hang them.\" Homosexuality was already a crime there, but the new legislation, rushed through parliament in December, broadens the scope of life imprisonment for a range of \"offences\" including suggestive touching in public. Museveni has until Sunday to sign, veto or amend the bill, and at first he indicated that he would knock it back.On 18 January, the Associated Press (AP) reported, he held a meeting with US-based rights activists and, on the phone, South African retired archbishop Desmond Tutu, who drew a comparison between the legislation and racist laws under apartheid. Museveni \"specifically said this bill is a fascist bill,\" Santiago Canton of the Robert F Kennedy Centre for Justice and Human Rights told AP. \"Those were the first words that came out of his mouth.\"Something changed his mind. A month later the president, under domestic pressure, announced that he would sign the bill after receiving a report on homosexuality from a team of \"medical experts\". But the Observer has obtained the report, entitled \"Scientific statement from the ministry of health on homosexuality\"; it is far from the bigots' charter that might be expected. \"Homosexuality existed in Africa way before the coming of the white man,\" it states. \"There are a spectrum of sexual behaviours. Some people are less fixed in one form of sexuality than others. Thus sexuality is a far more flexible human quality than used to be assumed in the past. Homosexuality has no clear cut cause; several factors are involved which differ from individual to individual. It is not a disease that has a treatment.\"But Simon Lokodo argues that the most important conclusion is that there is no definitive gene for homosexuality. \"It is a social style of life that is acquired,\" he said by phone from Uganda. \"They chose to be homosexual and are trying to recruit others. The commercialisation of homosexuality is unacceptable. If they were doing it in their own rooms we wouldn't mind, but when they go for children, that's not fair. They are beasts of the forest.\"With chilling conviction, Lokodo, a former Catholic priest, set out why he believes the state should interfere in the choices of consenting adults in private. \"Homosexuality is unnatural, abnormal and strange to our cultures,\" he said. \"It has no output whatsoever; it only does damage and destruction. You cannot have a right to be a sick human being. There is no right in homosexuality. It must be cured.\"The minister has also considered the anatomical implications. \"Excretion is through the anus, like the exhaust of an engine. The human body receives what it takes from the mouth. They're twisting nature the wrong way. Homosexuality will destroy humanity because there is no procreation; it will destroy health because the backsides will not hold.\"After the bill drew criticism from Barack Obama, Lokodo accused the west of trying to \"blackmail\" Uganda. \"When I heard the US saying they will cut aid, we said fine. Will they be comfortable if we come to America and started practising polygamy? Homosexuality is strange to us and polygamy is strange to you. We have divergent views.\"Promoters of the bill in Uganda, which gained independence from Britain in 1962, appealed to populist notions of culture that frame homosexuality as an \"un-African\", alien behaviour foisted on the continent by western imperialists. Seen through this prism, a strike against gay and lesbian people is a strike against colonialism and in favour of African nationalism and self-worth.Yet as the scientists' report noted, homosexuality has existed throughout human history. Anthropologists found an ethnic group in central Africa where it was customary for a male warrior to marry a teenage boy and celebrate victory in battle by having sexual intercourse. In many cases, the very laws being imposed so zealously were introduced by the European empires that carved up and plundered Africa.\"Prior to western colonisation, there are no records of any African laws against homosexuality,\" said Peter Tatchell, the veteran human rights and gay rights campaigner. \"The real import into Africa was not homosexuality but homophobia.\"It was enforced legally by colonial administrators and ideologically by Christian missionaries. Tatchell, who twice tried to arrest Zimbabwean president Robert Mugabe over human rights abuses, added: \"The colonial narratives of racism and homophobia are very closely intertwined. It's one of the great tragedies of Africa that so many people have internalised the homophobia of that colonial oppression and now proclaim it as their own authentic African tradition.\"Defence of \"tradition\" can be a sleight of hand to trade on cultural relativism and exploit postcolonial guilt. Some in the west may be reluctant to criticise African attitudes, lest they be accused of racism. But activists counter that they are appealing to human rights, such as the right not to be tortured, that apply everywhere at all times. A minority has an absolute right to be protected from violations by a majority, they argue.This counts for little at the altar of political expediency, however, according to Kapya Kaoma, an Episcopal priest from Zambia, and religion and sexuality researcher at the US-based thinktank Political Research Associates. Politicians tend to \"blame the gays\" to distract attention from their own failings, he says, casting them as the enemy within. Mugabe peppered his speeches with praise of Adam and Eve and denunciations of homosexuals as animals while electioneering last year.The share of the sub-Saharan Africa population that is Christian climbed from 9% in 1910 to 63% in 2010, says the Pew Research Centre. Kaoma said: \"Religious fundamentalism is strong in these countries. That provides the militant reaction to LGBT rights. One of the fears for fundamentalists is losing grip of the country; they are told they have lost grip because of the gays. They say, 'We don't want to lose Nigeria or Uganda just as our brothers lost America to the gays. If it means killing, we will kill.'\" He said homosexuality is a rare point of convergence for Christian and Islamic hardliners.US evangelicals have been accused of turning their attention to Africa and whipping up homophobia with lurid stories about child molestation, bestiality, rape and deadly diseases. Kaoma reflected: \"In America the conservatives are losing. In Africa they are winning and the progressives are on the retreat. People are not paying attention to how world religions are taking advantage of globalisation. Those opposed to gay rights can connect very easily with African groups opposed to gay rights. In the past they had to travel; now they send an email and share tactics. Conservatives argue that gays are out to destroy 'traditional family values'; as Africans encounter fast-changing values, this language sounds very attractive.\"There is, however, a paradox in the wave of oppression: the harsh laws being enacted may be a measure not of failure but of success, a reaction to gay and lesbians asserting their political identity and rights as never before. Graeme Reid, director of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender rights programme at Human Rights Watch, said: \"I do see it as a backlash against the increasing visibility. Over the last 25 years there's been an unprecedented growth of LGBT movements across sub-Saharan Africa. Clearly, this is an indigenous African phenomenon. There are various reasons: one is the HIV/Aids epidemic and the funding that became available for men who have sex with men. There was a more open discussion around sexuality.\"Anyone who attended the recent opening of the Queer and Trans Art-iculations: Collaborative Art for Social Change, an exhibition at the Wits Art Museum in Johannesburg, could not help but feel hopeful. Many among the spectacular first-night crowd were confidently gay, lesbian, transgender and, in the word of one guest, \"performative\". Despite the works' reminder of the deadly hate crimes that persist in South Africa, the event's celebratory, out-and-proud atmosphere offered a glimpse of another possible future.Last week, Edwin Cameron, a South African constitutional court judge, and one of the first public figures in Africa to come out as gay and HIV-positive, reflected: \"The most interesting thing going on here is what I call an 'unstable transition'. It explains the force of the backlash just as African gays and lesbians are starting to come out. It releases hatred and rage, but what is happening is irreversible. Gays and lesbians are coming to consciousness, organising themselves and speaking out.\"Gay rightsAfricaYoweri MuseveniSexualityUgandaHuman rightsAmnesty InternationalNigeriaDesmond TutuPeter TatchellDavid Smiththeguardian.com &copy; 2014 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"President embraces a twisted 'African morality' with willingness to trade anti-gay law for one more term in officeLike any other dictator, Uganda's Yoweri Museveni is addicted to attention. And what better way to guarantee attention than promising an African utopia, free from homosexuals, pornography or any such moral decadence imported from the west?Museveni's apparent willingness to sign the anti-homosexuality bill – taking all \"scientific\" evidence into account – was a simple transaction whose reward would be another term in power.No, it was not a hideous, shameful trade-off that he and his party's MPs did behind closed doors. Everything was captured on camera and broadcast for all to see. To show his commitment to the MPs, in the meantime he signed a law that many have understood to outlaw miniskirts.Ululation at the promise to stomp gays and immorality out of the country was followed by members of parliament pleading, begging, and cajoling the old man. Could he please run one more term, if only to finish the fight against poverty that he started 28 years ago, fix the roads whose funds his ministers already spent on personal projects and put drugs in hospitals his family would not trust to treat a cold or to deliver a first daughter's baby.The highlight was a female MP, Evelyn Anite, kneeling down to present the petition that endorsed the president as the sole candidate for his party come 2016. In some Ugandan ethnicities, women kneel for men as a sign that they are subservient.When he came to power Museveni promised to uplift women and spearheaded the enactment of a constitution that would guarantee equality for all Ugandans. Then, he recognised that there is no such thing as a pure African culture. That same African culture he is now \"protecting\" displaced women from their land, killed innocent children for having disabilities and mutilated women and children's genitalia.Museveni, who is by no means stupid, recognised that it was time for Africa to look colonialism in the eye, count her losses and move on. Early in his regime, there was a sexual revolution, the beginning of genuine recovery from Idi Amin's era, when women were not allowed to wear miniskirts and intolerance reigned.But like most revolutionaries, Museveni lost focus and the benefits of the revolution started to matter less. Women being undressed on the street for being \"indecent\", homosexuals imprisoned and killed are a small price to pay for another chance to dupe Ugandans.Instead of using the power of persuasion he is gifted with to explain to the populace that culture is dynamic and Africa must find it in her tolerant heart to embrace diversity, Museveni has sought the easy way out and sided with the populace to reinforce intolerance from the post-colonial era.The Bible and the Pentecostal movement, of which his wife Janet is a devout member, have come in handy. Museveni and his cronies know that there is no such thing as recruiting people into homosexuality. The law, which requires everybody to spy on homosexuals, is unenforceable. But there is nothing left for the regime to promise.Roads have never been built, hospitals have only become worse and even the HIV/Aids successes have stalled for a while now.Museveni's conscience may have died, but even he knows that the slogan of democracy, equality and good governance that he once used would now look somewhat awkward on his campaign posters.An untainted African morality is more appealing to most – especially the products of government universal primary education who hit voting age every year. They may find it hard to read beyond their names, but surely they can imagine an Africa that has something to offer the world other than disease and poverty – a new morality.They will not question the incoherent mumblings about the evils of homosexuality, but they are ripe enough to begin the cleansing that will finally let Africa shine.And Africa is shining, in its own twisted way. From Cameroon, Nigeria, Uganda and now even Kenya with her \"emerging economy\", the continent is casting a hateful glare on gays.But the thing about glares is that they light up even the darkest corners. If you are bathing in the dark and it is cast in your direction, you might look up and find the entire neighbourhood staring at your naked backside.And maybe, just maybe, the homosexual witch-hunt is what it will take for Africa and the rest of the world to see that dictators like Museveni have nothing more to offer.Yoweri MuseveniUgandaAfricaGay rightsSexualityPatience Akumutheguardian.com &copy; 2014 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The default position for a child of mixed race is that they are black.\"The report found that those with mixed-race backgrounds were more at risk of mental health issues because of their struggle to develop an identity. Morley said the strongest common experience was the \"too white to be black, too black to be white\".The 2011 census showed that the mixed-race population was the fastest growing ethnic group in Britain, amounting to 2.2% of the population of England and Wales.In 2012, research by the thinktank British Future found that prejudice towards mixed-race relationships was fading.

"rates,", "requires" ], "summary" : "When Barack Obama calls inequality the 'defining challenge of the era', conservatives change the subjectBarack Obama calls inequality the \"defining challenge of our era\". Polls show that a majority of Americans now believe that inequality has grown over the past decade and favour tax increases on the wealthy to help the poor. The non-partisan Pew Research Centre recently found that six out of 10 Americans believe their economic system unfairly favours the wealthy.What's the reaction of conservatives? They want to change the subject. Those with presidential ambitions say we should focus on poverty rather than inequality. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida points to the \"lack of mobility\" of the poor as the core problem. Representative Paul Ryan of Wisconsin blames their isolation from mainstream America. \"On every measure from education levels to marriage rates, poor families are drifting further away from the middle class.\"Conservative New York Times columnist David Brooks argues that the \"interrelated social problems of the poor\" have nothing to do with inequality. Even some Democratic operatives are worried that talking about inequality will turn off voters. \"However salient reducing income inequality may be,\" writes Mark Mellman, a Democratic pollster, \"it is demonstrably less important to voters than any number of other priorities\" – including reducing poverty.This is rubbish. Widening inequality is making it harder for the poor to escape poverty and thwarting equal opportunity. Let me explain. When almost all the gains from growth go to the top, as they have for the last 30 years, the vast middle class doesn't have the purchasing power necessary to keep the economy growing and generate lots of jobs.Once the middle class has exhausted all its coping mechanisms – wives and mothers surging into paid work (as they did in the 1970s and 1980s), longer working hours (which characterised the 1990s) and deep indebtedness (2002-2008), the inevitable result is slower growth and fewer jobs.Slow growth and few jobs hit the poor especially hard because they're the first to be fired, last to be hired, and most likely to bear the brunt of declining wages and benefits.A stressed middle class also has a harder time being generous to those in need. It's no coincidence that the tax revolts that began thundering across America in the late 1970s occurred just when middle-class wages began stagnating. Helping America's poor presumably requires money, but the fiscal cupboard is bare – and the only way to replenish it is through tax increases on the wealthy because the middle class is stretched to the limit. The shrinking middle class also hobbles upward mobility. Not only is there less money for good schools, job training and social services, but the poor face a more difficult challenge moving upward because the income ladder is far longer and its middle rungs have disappeared.American conservatives also don't want to acknowledge any connection between widening inequality and unequal political power. Brooks, for example, warns that any discussion of unequal political power will make it harder to reach political consensus over what to do for the poor.But it's precisely the concentration of power at the top – which flows largely from the concentration of income and wealth there – that has prevented Washington from dealing with the problems of the poor and the middle class. As wealth has accumulated at the top, Washington has reduced taxes on the wealthy, expanded loopholes that disproportionately benefit the rich, deregulated Wall Street and provided ever larger subsidies, bailouts and tax breaks for large corporations. The only things that have trickled down to the middle and poor, besides fewer jobs and lower salaries, are public services that are increasingly inadequate because they're starved of funds.Unequal political power is the endgame of widening inequality – its most noxious and nefarious consequence. Big money has all but engulfed Washington and many state capitals – drowning out the voices of average Americans, filling the campaign chests of candidates who will do their bidding, financing attacks on organised labour and bankrolling a vast empire of rightwing thinktanks and publicists that fill the airwaves with half-truths and distortions.The final reason conservative Republicans would rather talk about poverty than about inequality is because they can then characterise the poor as \"them\" – people who are different from most of us, who have brought their problems on themselves, who lack self-discipline or adequate motivation. Accordingly, in their view, any attempt to alleviate poverty requires that \"they\" change their ways.US politicsUnited StatesBarack ObamaTax and spendingRobert Reichtheguardian.com &copy; 2014 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"original" ], "summary" : "Learning by rote is not the answer – unlocking the creative power of problem-solving is what will enthuse British schoolchildren and make them world-class, argues mathematician Conrad WolframReading the headlines of outrage after international school maths tests showed Britain lagging far behind Asian countries, you might conclude that our children are bad at maths. But is this the case?Even if the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) tests decently reflect today's maths standards, I believe that simply trying to climb up the table is wrong.The problem is not the difference between Britain and Shanghai – which education minister Elizabeth Truss visited on a fact-finding mission last week – but the worldwide difference between maths in education and maths in the real world: everywhere, we are teaching largely the wrong maths.Here's why. In the real world we use computers for calculating, almost universally; in education we use people for calculating, almost universally.This growing chasm is a key reason why maths is so despised in education and yet so powerful and important in real life. We have confused rigour at hand-calculating with rigour for the wider problem-solving subject of maths – the necessary hand mechanics of past moments with the enduring essence of maths.At its heart, maths is the world's most successful system of problem solving. The point is to take real things we want to work out and apply, or invent, maths to get the answer. One example involves four steps: define the question, translate it to mathematical formulation of that question, calculate or compute the answer in maths-speak and then translate it back to answer your original question, verifying that it really does.The central change in real-world maths of the last 50 or so years is that we automated the hell out of calculating. Computers now do a fantastically better job than people – even well-trained ones – in almost all cases. An example I like to give is to pick up my iPhone, activate its Siri voice recognition and say: \"Solve x cubed plus 2x plus one equals zero.\"With any luck, back comes the answer – the three solutions, presented with graphs and formulas. This is a cubic which, except in special cases, even further maths A-level students don't get to.In schools most of us learn the formula for solving a quadratic equation, but not a cubic. You must seriously question why we are spending years of our students' lives failing to be able to compute what my phone did in seconds. Instead, they should be grappling with real problems and applying maths to them. Defining questions and abstracting them to maths are crucial steps that Britain's (and other countries') schools spend woefully little time on, because students laboriously practise obsolete hand calculating skills.Worse, the curriculum forces the use of toy problems. Real problems tend to be harder and messier, but it's possible to handle such problems only if computers do the calculating.Indeed, it's the mechanisation of calculating that's powered maths to be applicable to so wide a swath of society. From medicine to mobile phones to finance, to the very computing technology that drives it, maths has become usable and useful because we've mechanised computing answers so successfully.One of the scariest aspects of maths for many students is how disconnected from anything in their lives it seems to be. After my 2010 TED talk on the subject, a huge number commented to the effect: \"This is the first person who's explained why any of the maths I learnt at school has any relevance to my life.\"What a waste of human endeavour when the world's population is spending 20,000 student lifetimes a year learning hand-calculating.Why would they use an equation, what problem would they be solving with it and how do they set it up? Even when our current system tries to give a context for maths, the problems are contrived so they're solvable with weak hand-calculating techniques, so that everyone can see that they are not useful in real life.In real life the problem leads, and if the computation is messy and complex that's OK, the computer will probably cope. By removing the computer from maths education you remove most of the real context.Just to be clear. I'm talking about using the computer for doing the computation and changing the subject-matter – which I call computer-based maths – not for replacing the teacher or changing the delivery of the existing content. Of course, we should modernise our delivery too, but however well we deliver the wrong subject it won't make it right.The real world should be your guide: no one seriously claims computers have made real-world maths less conceptually demanding; quite the contrary.Indeed, the reason governments around the world are panicked about maths is because of the chasm between students' understanding and real-life needs. It's not so much that maths education is worse than it was; instead, real life is much more demanding and we're running in the wrong direction to catch up.Instead of rote learning long-division procedures, let's get students applying the power of calculus, picking holes in government statistics, designing a traffic system or cracking secret codes. All are possible, all train both creativity and conceptual understanding and have practical results. But they need computers to do most of the calculating – just like we do in the real world.One recent direction that will help all of this is the government's new-found enthusiasm for computer coding in schools. Much of the reason given for why it's important is that everyone can understand the insides of the apps they're using.But I think there's a much deeper point. Code is the modern way in which you express maths and the way to get computers calculating: it's that central. There's one country that pushed coding in schools before the UK: Estonia. It is also the first country to use the computer-based maths education system. There, my company has just finished building a completely rethought probability and statistics curriculum.School students will be working on problems such as \"Am I normal?\", \"Are girls better at maths?\" \"Will it rain tomorrow?\" and \"Should I insure my laptop?\" They'll be using real, large datasets with all the difficulties that entails. They'll be doing coding and some of the maths they'll be handling is traditionally taught only at university.What's really impressive is that Estonia has already come top in Europe in Pisa. And it recognises how being top on today's playing field isn't what's needed for tomorrow. Where Estonia leads, others will follow – not just in the process of learning but in the subject matter. It's happened with coding. Now it needs to happen with school maths or it will go the way of classics. Those who lead the charge will reap the greatest rewards, as Britain did with universal education in the 19th century.Even better, I believe British culture makes us rather good creative problem-solvers, potentially world-beating if successfully tethered to the power of computer-based maths. Non-conformity, creativeness and looking around the rules is key to British (and Estonian) cultures and a great competitive, opposite to the cultural imperatives in many of the Asian countries doing well in maths tests, countries that may struggle to imbue such characteristics.Playing the wrong game badly is hardly smart. Let's lead in rewriting the rulebook and succeed at the right game. Visiting Estonia would be a start.Conrad Wolfram, physicist, mathematician and technologist, is founder of computerbasedmath.org MathematicsMathematicsEducation policyChinatheguardian.com &copy; 2014 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

The TUC study pinpoints how many older women have felt the need to return to work or to continue working until later in life, for a combination of reasons. These include the rising cost of living, the increase in the state pension age and the fall in value of workplace pensions.While much of the rise in female employment is due to the greater number of over-50s in the population, the rate of employment has risen too. In 1992, 50.7% of women in the 50-64 age group were economically \"inactive\", compared with 36.8% today.The TUC general secretary, Frances O'Grady, said: \"Many work because they want to and can take advantage of the new opportunities and attitudes that have opened up during their lifetimes. Others are working because they cannot afford not to. The living standards crisis, the increase in the state pension age and the decline in workplace pensions all put pressure on older women. Many will be the sole earner in a household, such as when they need to support a partner who can no longer work or cannot find a job.\"While the study finds reasons to celebrate more older women being in work, it raises concerns about low pay, lack of training and an acute gender pay gap between people in their 50s. Of all women over 50 in work, average pay is £15,000 a year; for women over 60 it is £11,000. The gender pay gap is also higher than for any other decade of life, with average full-time hourly earnings for women 18.4% below those of men.The TUC says this is because women are still being penalised, in terms of pay, for having children. \"Women in their 50s are effectively still paying the price for having taken time out of the labour market and having worked part time. Many of these women now find themselves still juggling low-paid, part-time work with caring responsibilities – those that no longer have dependent children may be doing regular care for their grandchildren, elderly parents or a sick or disabled partner.\"The report adds: \"Many returned to work after having children and struggled to combine work with childcare at a time when few employers offered flexible working. The fact that this generation of women earns a fifth less than their male counterparts and less than any other age group of women should set alarm bells ringing.\"The report finds that half of the women in work are part-timers, many of whom want to work longer hours.WomenOlder peopleWork & careersEmploymentGenderWork-life balancePayToby Helmtheguardian.com &copy; 2014 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

but the damage to populations of birds, mammals, fish and insects, and habitats, will also have a long-term impact on the ecosystemSeals, moles, hedgehogs, badgers, mice, earthworms and a host of insects and seabirds are among the unseen casualties of the floods, storms and torrential rains of the last few weeks, say wildlife groups.As the waters started to subside across England, conservationists reported that about 600 guillemots, puffins, razorbills, kittiwakes and gulls have been washed up on the south coast and 250 seals drowned in Norfolk, Cornwall and the Channel Islands. A further 11,000 seabirds are reported to have been found dead on the French coast.\"The relentless storms hitting our coast have had a cumulative effect on animals, which can usually cope with bad weather, but are now on really low reserves and are dying in large numbers,\" said Niki Clear from Cornwall Wildlife Trust, which has reported that dozens of seal pups were washed up on beaches.David Jarvis, director of British Divers Marine Life Rescue, said his organisation has been heavily involved in rescuing seals: \"Since January we have had 88 callouts to rescue marine wildlife, the vast majority concerning seal pups. We would normally expect approximately 150 in the whole year.\"Natural England, the government's independent wildlife advisory body, has reported damage to 48 of the UK's most important wildlife sites, including those of special scientific interest and national nature reserves. Tim Collins, Natural England's coastal specialist, said: \"It is estimated that some 4,500 hectares of designated coastal nature conservation sites in England were flooded.\"The sites affected mostly comprise coastal grazing marsh, saline lagoons and reed beds. All of these sites are of national importance, and 37 are also of international importance.\"Sea walls protecting at least 80 conservation sites have been breached in Norfolk, Suffolk, Kent and the Tees estuary.\"The scale and extent of the impact of flooding on many species is still being assessed, but it is expected that hibernating animals will have been the worst affected.Marina Pacheco, director of the Mammal Society, explained: \"Moles and field voles will have drowned if the flooding was rapid. If it was relatively slow, then they would have had a chance to move away, but that would have brought them into conflict with established populations so may result in injuries as they fight each other off.\"Mark Jones, of Humane Society International, said many other animals have also been affected: \"Some badger setts will almost certainly have been damaged or flooded out completely, meaning that whole families could be disturbed.\"Matt Shardlow, head of the invertebrate charity Buglife, noted that much depends on the habitat: \"Bumblebees, earthworms, snails, beetles and caterpillars living on floodplains have all been at risk in the floods and waterlogged ground.\"The biggest impact will have been in places that are not used to being flooded. Species living in floodplains will have adapted and can survive under water for considerable periods. It's been bad news for hibernating animals.\"Mould is the deadly enemy of insects and it does not stop growing. It means there could be fewer grubs for birds to feed on.\"The floods will have carried away thousands of tonnes of bug-rich topsoil, but if they continue the impact could be far worse, said Shardlow.\"After several weeks under water, plants start to decompose and, with oxygen in short supply, give off noxious fumes. If the floodwater were to be contaminated with pesticides or other toxic industrial chemicals, it could be devastating.\"Butterflies had a good summer in 2013 following some of the sunniest months in years, but many could have suffered from the wet. \"We can expect fewer butterflies this year,\" said a spokeswoman for the Butterfly Trust.Most natural sites are able to take occasional flooding, but any water polluted by overflowing drains, septic tanks or pesticides from farms and parks is likely to have exacted a toll on many animals. University of Reading microbiologists found highly elevated bacteria levels when they tested floodwaters in Somerset.But it's not all bad news. Some species are expected to have thrived in the wettest months recorded in 250 years. Wading birds and wildfowl have been able to feed across much larger wetland areas and are now feeding in large numbers on flooded grasslands and taking advantage of drowned invertebrates.But even fish species have suffered. Nearly 5,000 fish, for example, were found dead in fields near Goring-on-Thames in Oxfordshire after the river flooded then subsided quickly. \"When floods come, you can also lose the fry – newly-hatched fish – which get swept away,\" said Martin Salter of the Angling Trust.With very few frosty nights recorded so far this winter, and remarkably warm weather since Christmas, many conservationists now fear that a cold snap could prove disastrous for wildlife. \"A month of ice and snow on top of a long period when animals could not hibernate would be very serious indeed,\" said Shardlow.FloodingWeatherNatural disasters and extreme weatherWildlifeConservationAnimalsInsectsBirdsBadgersJohn Vidaltheguardian.com &copy; 2014 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

like many campaigning groups around the world, lament last week's high court verdict that it was quite OK to detain David Miranda, partner of Glenn Greenwald, for nine hours in a Heathrow lounge and strip him of the Snowden files he was carrying. Alternatively, you can join Stephen Glover and the Daily Mail in their celebrations (\"The arrogant left may gnash its teeth but our judges are right about this reckless threat to our security\"). Hope for a little agreement on the subtext, though.When the Mail thunders about statutory threats to press freedom, does it realise that it is merely defending \"journalistic expression\", which is \"a sub-class\" of the \"general case for free expression\", as the court puts it? Does it understand that judges are always the supreme arbiters of what constitutes public interest? And that, because security matters are inevitably a jigsaw newspapers can never see as a whole, it only needs some spook-wallah from Downing Street to declare this or that newspaper inquiry off-limits for the courts to jump to attention?Lord Justice Laws's judgment, in short, doesn't just disappoint Miranda, Greenwald and the Guardian. It says, in effect, that any security service type – maybe after a chat with PM Tony Blair, once he's finished helping Rebekah with something – can present \"compelling\", if studiously vague, evidence and see passing dossiers, however dodgy, enjoy portentous protection. It can, seemingly, declare media workers potential \"terrorists\" in a schedule 7 trice. It balances the right to be informed (article 10 of the European convention) against the security right to be forcibly shut up – and declares no contest.But haven't we heard all this before? Perhaps, over a quarter of a century ago, in the same high court. Here's Andrew Neil, then editor of the Sunday Times; and here's plain John Laws, then the \"Treasury devil\" who leads for HMG whenever and wherever required. The case is one of contempt, involving Spycatcher, an ex-MI5 officer's autobiography that No 10 wants to ban (because of the usual compelling arguments about safety). The Observer and Guardian broke the story and have been injuncted into silence. Now the Sunday Times, along with the Indy and News on Sunday, have got a bit more into print.But Neil has used \"peculiarly sneaky methods\" to get his extracts into print, says Laws. He \"believes it is for his judgment of what is in the public interest, not the courts', when a question arises on whether his paper should or should not publish a story\". Plus ça change … and the parallels run on.Downing Street dispatched high-level witnesses – including a suffering cabinet secretary – around the world's courtrooms, expecting them to dance to the UK's security tune. But Spycatcher was published in Australia, America, Europe and then even Scotland before the English operation collapsed under the weight of its absurdity, a jigsaw strewn across the carpet. The European court of human rights – citing article 10 – found against Margaret Thatcher. It was a mixture of pantomime and pandemonium, with poor Laws doomed to play Widow Twankey.Now here we go again, pretending revelations that have already transfixed America and echoed round the globe can be kept in a Cheltenham box. Laws and his rather muted colleagues exalt freedom of expression for the citizen but not for the facts – the crucial facts – that could give this freedom reality.Yet, in one respect, this is not 1987 all over again. Then the press gradually made common cause. The Guardian and Observer weren't dubbed arrogant lefties and allowed to stew. Rupert Murdoch's Sunday Times and the Indy (with its co-founder, Stephen Glover) pushed back. David English's Daily Mail proved a supporter in need. There was a clear perception of threat, and of a judiciary compellingly up the creek.

EARTH-SHATTERING SOUND!\" – which I dare say accurately describes one of the grimmest episodes of the second world war.Made by the director of 2005 Afghanistan war drama The 9th Company – and a leading Putin supporter – this account of the Battle of Stalingrad spares no expense, or CGI firepower, to tell the tale of five brave soldiers and a plucky lass (Maria Smolnikova) who stand alone between the German army and the Volga. Bizarrely framed by an episode about the Japanese tsunami relief, this visually murky, narratively clunky drama feels like a throwback to the Soviet cinema of the 60s, with a splash of Sam Peckinpah and the odd Matrix-style flying-bullet effect. Stalingrad is certainly watchable in its overwrought bombast, but it's less a film than a $30m ideological monument. It proves the Marxian adage that history repeats itself, first as tragedy, then as special-effects kitsch.Rating: 2/5War filmsDramaSecond world warJonathan Romneytheguardian.com &copy; 2014 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

over critics but this tasteless film teaches us nothing and merely indulges the unrepentant butchers of IndonesiaThe Act of Killing won the documentary prize at the Baftas last week and is the favourite to win the much-coveted Oscar. I watch many documentaries on behalf of the BBC each year and I go to festivals. I'm a doc obsessive. By my own, not quite reliable reckoning, I've been asked by fans to show The Act of Killing on the BBC at least five times. I've never encountered a film greeted by such extreme responses – both those who say it is among the best films and those who tell me how much they hate it. Much about the film puzzles me. I am still surprised by the fact that so many critics listed it among their favourite films of last year.For those who haven't seen the film, it investigates the circumstances in which half-a-million Indonesian leftists were murdered in the 1960s, at the instigation of a government that is still in power. You might think this is a recondite subject, worthy of a late-night screening for insomniacs or atrocity buffs on BBC4, but, no, the film-maker Joshua Oppenheimer has made the subject viewable by enlisting the participation of some of the murderers. He spent some years hanging out with them, to his credit luring them into confessions. But he also, more dubiously, enlisted their help in restaging their killings. Although one of them, the grandfatherly Anwar, shows mild symptoms of distress towards the end of the film, they live in a state of impunity and it is thus, coddled and celebrated in their old age, that we revisit them.So let me be as upfront as I can. I dislike the aesthetic or moral premise of The Act of Killing. I find myself deeply opposed to the film. Getting killers to script and restage their murders for the benefit of a cinema or television audience seems a bad idea for a number of reasons. I find the scenes where the killers are encouraged to retell their exploits, often with lip-smacking expressions of satisfaction, upsetting not because they reveal so much, as many allege, but because they tell us so little of importance. Of course murderers, flattered in their impunity, will behave vilely. Of course they will reliably supply enlightened folk with a degraded vision of humanity. But, sorry, I don't feel we want to be doing this. It feels wrong and it certainly looks wrong to me. Something has gone missing here. How badly do we want to hear from these people, after all? Wouldn't it be better if we were told something about the individuals whose lives they took?I'd feel the same if film-makers had gone to rural Argentina in the 1950s, rounding up a bunch of ageing Nazis and getting them to make a film entitled \"We Love Killing Jews\". Think of other half-covered-up atrocities – in Bosnia, Rwanda, South Africa, Israel, any place you like with secrets – and imagine similar films had been made. Consider your response – and now consider whether such goings-on in Indonesia are not acceptable merely because the place is so far away, and so little known or talked about that the cruelty of such an act can pass uncriticised.The film does not in any recognisable sense enhance our knowledge of the 1960s Indonesian killings, and its real merits – the curiosity when it comes to uncovering the Indonesian cult of anticommunism capable of masking atrocity, and the good and shocking scenes with characters from the Indonesian elite, still whitewashing the past – are obscured by tasteless devices. At the risk of being labelled a contemporary prude or dismissed as a stuffy upholder of middle-class taste, I feel that no one should be asked to sit through repeated demonstrations of the art of garrotting. Instead of an investigation, or indeed a genuine recreation, we've ended somewhere else – in a high-minded snuff movie.What I like most about documentary film is that anything can be made to work, given a chance. You can mix up fact and fiction, past and present. You can add to cold objectivity a degree of empathy. You will, of course, lie to reluctant or recalcitrant participants, in particular when they wish not to divulge important pieces of information. And trickery has its place, too. But documentary films have emerged from the not inconsiderable belief that it's good to be literal as well as truthful. In a makeshift, fallible way, they tell us what the world is really like. Documentaries are the art of the journeyman. They can be undone by too much ambition. Too much ingenious construction and they cease to represent the world, becoming reflected images of their own excessively stated pretensions.In his bizarrely eulogistic piece defending The Act of Killing (of which he is an executive producer), Errol Morris, the documentary maker, compares the film to Hamlet's inspired use of theatre to reveal dirty deeds at the court of Denmark. But Hamlet doesn't really believe that theatrical gestures can stand in for reality. Nor, we must assume, did his creator. A more apt analogy than Morris's might come from Shakespeare's darkest play, Macbeth. What would we think if Macbeth and his scheming wife were written out of the action, replaced by those low-level thugs paid to do bad business on their behalf? We might conclude that putting them centre stage, in the style of The Act of Killing, was indeed perverse and we'd be right.There are still half-forgotten, heavily whitewashed atrocities from the last century, such as the Bengali famine allowed to occur during the second world war through the culpably racist inattention of British officials; the never wholly cleared-up question of Franco's mass killings; or the death of so many millions in the 1950s as a consequence of Mao's catastrophic utopianism. Those wondering how to record such events will no doubt watch The Act of Killing, but I hope they will also look at less hyped, more modestly conceived depictions of mass murder. In Enemies of the People (2010), the Cambodian journalist Thet Sambath goes after the murderers of the Khmer Rouge. He finds Pol Pot's sidekick, but it is the earnest, touching quest of Sambath himself that lingers in the mind, rather than the empty encounters with evil-doers. Atrocity is both banal and ultimately impossible to comprehend.Writing in 1944, Arthur Koestler was among the first to gain knowledge of the slaughter of eastern European Jews and he estimated that the effect of such revelations was strictly limited, lasting only minutes or days and swiftly overcome by indifference. Koestler suggested that there was only one way we could respond to the double atrocity of mass murder and contemporary indifference and that was by screaming.I'm grateful to The Act of Killing not because it's a good film, or because it deserves to win its Oscar (I don't think it does), but because it reminds me of the truth of Koestler's observation. What's not to scream about?Nick Fraser is editor of the BBC's Storyville documentary seriesWar crimesDocumentaryIndonesiaOscars 2014Errol MorrisKhmer RougePol PotArthur KoestlerNick Frasertheguardian.com &copy; 2014 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

"Street", "came", "time", "rates,", "cities,", "original", "once" ], "summary" : "Hugo Chávez's dream world has become a nightmare of shot-down protesters, jailed oppositionists, economic meltdown and a brutal war waged against a defiant middle classHugo Chávez used to call it la revolución bonita (the pretty revolution), but the world looked at Venezuela last week and saw only ugliness. Protesters gunned down in the streets, barricades in flames, chaos. One of the dead was a 22-year-old beauty queen shot in the head.With the government censoring and cowing TV reports, many of the images came from smartphones, grainy and jerky snippets filled with smoke and shouts. One fact loomed through them all: Chavismo, a hybrid system of democracy and autocracy built on populism, petro-dollars and quasi-socialism, was reaping the consequences of misrule.Demonstrations in Caracas, Valencia, Mérida and other cities turned lethal, with student-led rallies provoking a fierce backlash from National Guard units and paramilitaries. They roared on motorcycles into \"enemy\" neighbourhoods, guns blazing. Families piled mattresses against windows to shield against bullets.Human Rights Watch accused security forces of excessive and unlawful force by beating detainees and shooting at unarmed crowds. Worse may come. Jailings, beatings and killings have galvanised rather than deterred the mostly middle-class protesters. They vowed to continue until la salida, the exit of a government that has held power under Chávez, and now President Nicolás Maduro, for 15 years. \"Change depends on every one of us. Don't give up!\" Lilian Tintori, the wife of a jailed opposition leader, Leopoldo López, said via Twitter. Banners fluttered from buildings and barricades. \"I declare myself in civil disobedience,\" read one.In a televised speech to red-shirted supporters, Maduro accused the US of fomenting a coup and threatened Táchira, a particularly rebellious eastern state, with martial law. A local mayor would soon join López behind bars, he vowed. \"It's a matter of time until we have him in the same cold cell.\" An official policy of \"communicational hegemony\" harnessed state media for propaganda, intimidated privately owned broadcasters, yanked one TV channel off the air and revoked work permits for four CNN journalists.It may have resembled a regime's desperate battle for survival, affecting not just Venezuela but also its ally Cuba, which depends on Caracas for subsidised oil and supporters in the west who consider it a leftist beacon.In reality, though protests continue, the outcome is not in doubt. The government controls the police, army and courts and retains support among the poor. It remains an entrenched, formidable system of power untroubled by external threats. Despite the expulsion of three US diplomats – a staple of chavista political theatre – there is no evidence of a Washington plot.The convulsions were partly confected. López, an ambitious, Harvard-educated politician, steered student protests against crime and economic problems into a wider challenge to authority. A radical minority attacked state property with stones and petrol bombs, prompting the ferocious response by security forces and militias known as colectivos, leaving at least six dead, scores wounded and cities echoing to the sound of enraged pot-banging, a traditional form of dissent.\"I recommend they buy some stainless steel pots to last for a good 10, 20, 30 or 40 years,\" Maduro mocked. \"Because the revolution is here for a long time!\"History suggests that the president will prevail. Street protests briefly ousted his mentor in 2002 with the aid of a military-led coup tacitly backed by Washingon. Chávez bounced back. Protesters tried and failed again in 2003 by shutting down the oil industry, Venezuela's lifeblood. This time the generals and drillers appear firmly under government control. By rallying his fractious ruling coalition, Maduro could emerge even stronger.That will not mean the revolution has won. On the contrary. In a broader, historical sense, it has already lost. This tropical would-be alternative to capitalism is a husk. It faces an existential threat not from youths chanting in plazas but from the fact that Venezuela is a shambolic, crumbling, dysfunctional ruin.Start with the economy. The official inflation rate, 56%, is among the world's highest. There are shortages of bread, flour, meat, toilet paper and other basics. The bolívar currency has collapsed in value and is virtually unconvertible. Agriculture and industry are gasping. Newspapers are running out of paper. Airlines are threatening to cut services because the government owes them $3.3bn. Food companies are owed $2.4bn. Bond prices have plunged to levels associated with default. Recession hovers. An infrastructure once the envy of South America has suffered from lack of investment and maintenance. Power cuts leave cities in darkness. Potholes make highways look like they have been mortared. Cobwebs shroud abandoned cable cars. Even the facade of the presidential palace, Miraflores, peels and rots.Crime is out of control. The government has stopped publishing regular statistics, but NGOs estimate the murder rate at 25,000 annually, one of the world's highest per capita rates, deadlier than Iraq. Kidnappings – people are snatched for ransom from bus stops, universities, shopping malls, airports – compound public anxiety. Corrupt police and politicised, overwhelmed courts breed impunity. An estimated 97% of murders go unpunished. The list goes on. A catalogue of neglect and decay. This does not signify collapse. Venezuela is the original El Dorado, a land that seduced conquistadores with a false promise of gold only to find itself atop the world's biggest oil reserves. Billions of petro-dollars gush into the treasury every month, a replenishing source of patronage. Yet the nation's stitches are coming loose. Venezuela is unravelling.Even if the protests abate, Maduro faces a desolate vista that mocks chavismo's grandiose rhetoric. An anti-imperialist beacon? A new path for humanity? Not while fistfights break out in supermarkets over scarce chickens. Or a diaspora of the best and brightest scatters around the world.Middle-class anger the government can canalise and convert into polarisation, a venerable, successful strategy. But danger lies in discontent in the barrios and pueblos, the hillside slums and dusty villages that comprise core support. It almost sank the revolution a month after Chávez's death from cancer last March when Maduro, despite lopsided advantages in money, media and institutional control, managed just a narrow, contested election victory over opposition leader Henrique Capriles. That was a sign that government patronage and handouts – jobs, subsidies, houses, electrical goods –were no longer sufficient compensation for the shortages, inflation and crime.Chávez, first elected in 1998, created the system. A gifted politician and communicator, he expanded social programmes that sharply reduced poverty, cementing his image as champion of the underdog. But he proved to be a disastrous manager. Expropriations, subsidies and currency and price controls trapped the economy in a populist labyrinth. A historic oil boom and manic spending sustained the illusion of a new Jerusalem. You could fill an SUV tank for 60p. Chávez dreamily spoke of the population doubling, even quadrupling. He changed the clocks, the flag, the country's name, vowed to build new cities, artificial islands, a transcontinental pipeline.There was a whiff of Ozymandias to it all, but foreign supporters applauded the fantasy. Oliver Stone, visiting Caracas to make a documentary, looked blank when I asked about the distortions and corruption haemorrhaging the economy. Shrewder observers – writers and academics – would visit and confide over rum that, yes, it all seemed a bit chaotic, then return home and publicly laud the revolution's progress.The squandering reached such proportions that even amid record oil revenues Chávez had to borrow billions from China to confect artificial booms before elections. Maduro inherited this model – and made it worse. Where Chávez had the confidence to bow to economic sanity and make painful adjustments, his successor, weaker and unloved by many on his own side, has plumped for even more reckless populism, ordering supermarkets to slash prices, jailing business owners as \"speculators\", sending troops to stores to liberate washing machines \"for the people\".\"We are in a critical situation of shortages and that's only the tip of the iceberg,\" said Luis Vicente León, a Caracas pollster. He predicted the difficulties would soon worsen. Workers at state-owned factories in Ciudad Guayana are in near open revolt. Teachers, doctors and nurses take turns striking. Chávez's gift for showmanship enabled him to create distractions and defuse frustration, but Maduro, stiff and wooden in comparison, relies more on thuggery. Hence the coordinated and symbolic assaults by \"motorizados\" on middle class neighbourhoods.There is no more pretence that the revolution is pretty. It is in the business of keeping power, no more, no less. It offers no solution to the fiasco, the tragedy, that is Venezuela.Rory Carroll was based in Caracas as the Guardian and Observer Latin America correspondent from 2006-12.

"time", "understand" ], "summary" : "French cooks are whingeing about customers taking cameraphone pictures of their dishes. They should suck it upAs someone who enjoys food, I'm surprised by how irritable chefs make me. Whenever I read about a chef or chefs campaigning for, complaining about or promoting something, I can feel myself metaphorically folding my arms. And sometimes I literally fold my arms at the same time – which, if you count both real and metaphorical limbs, briefly makes me an insect. A disdainful beetle, gearing up to get cross with a chef.\"Oh what is it now, chefs?\" I sneer to myself – not out loud because chefs are famously handy; I'm thinking of Gordon Ramsay, or John Cleese in that sketch where he bursts out of the kitchen waving a cleaver. \"You moaning chefs get my goat, which left to you would presumably be locally sourced, turned into a jus or a foam and piped all over a perfectly harmless starter! Why don't you shut up, you bloody chefs?\"You may be uncertain what I'm talking about. What are all these occasions when chefs say, want or bemoan something, you may wonder. Maybe my chef-irritability is making me delusional – but to my mind it's constant. Some chef is always saying something, and it's never just \"Can you make sure that doesn't boil over – I'm popping out for a fag.\"It's probably the fault of the media – most things are. When you've retyped all the news agency stuff about Syria and Ukraine, and reprinted today's cameraphone snap of a goose swimming past someone's upstairs window, what are you going to put on page 2? Probably best just to ring up some chefs and find out what's bugging them.My view of chefs as a vocal part of the community is reinforced by the fact that most television programmes are now about cookery – about 52% according to a survey I just conducted into what would bolster my argument. I quite like cookery programmes – something I have in common with every other viewer. That's why there are so many. The future of television, according to haircuts and focus groups, is stuff that everyone quite likes, rather than stuff that anyone particularly likes. It's best just to make cookery programmes, because dramas are expensive, nature documentaries are fake and those horrible panel shows are brash and rude and have more chefs on them than women. But no one ever got annoyed by shots of a casserole.So, I already had more metaphorically folded arms than a metaphorical millipede exchanging insurance details with some chefs who'd just crashed into his car, when I heard the latest from the chefs: they're annoyed by shots of a casserole. Or probably not actually a casserole – that sounds a bit 70s – more likely a reduction or a daube or a posset or a phucking pho. They're cross that customers often photograph (or pho-tograph) their food and put those images online.These particular chefs are French, which, I must admit, doesn't allay my suspicions that they may not have quite got over themselves. So I'd completely prejudged Alexandre Gauthier (of La Grenouillère in La Madelaine-sous-Montreuil) before I heard what he had to say – which, as it turns out, was an efficient use of time.\"They used to come and take pictures of themselves and their family, their grandmother, whoever, as a souvenir,\" he said of his customers. \"Now they take pictures of the food, they put it on Facebook or Twitter, they comment. And then the food is cold… I would like people to be living in the present. Tweet about the meal beforehand, tweet about it afterwards, but in between stop and eat.\" To this end, he's printed pictures of cameras with lines through them on all the menus.You may think he's got a point. People's urge to photograph every aspect of their lives is pretty wearing – I wish they wouldn't do it too. But my sympathy for him melts like sorbet under a flashbulb when he progresses from wishing they wouldn't to trying to stop them. They've bought the food: if they want to take a picture of it, that's their choice. Just as it's his choice to be irritated rather than flattered.The implication that these plates of grub should be treated with reverence makes me bridle. And it's even worse because they already are being treated with reverence but he's objecting to the nature of that reverence. It's too disrespectful a form of respect: he doesn't want people cooing and snapping with joy as if his masterpieces were merely a birthday knickerbocker-glory with sparklers in it – he wants the murmured acclamation of an art gallery.Nevertheless Gauthier claims that he's \"not banned photographs at all\" (which doesn't make much sense as I don't see what else could be inferred from the signs on the menus). And neither has his fellow complainant, Gilles Goujon (inventor of the goujon?) of the Auberge du Vieux Puits – but that's only because he hasn't \"yet found the right words that won't be too shocking\". He hates his food to be photographed because \"it takes away the surprise\", \"it takes away a little bit of my intellectual property\" and \"a photo taken on an average smartphone… doesn't give the best impression of our work\".I understand his feelings, but basically he needs to suck it up. If his customers have trawled strangers' Facebook pages and Twitter accounts for inexpertly-photographed gourmet meal spoilers, they only have themselves to blame if their expensive dinner's appearance fails to exhilarate. And Goujon's still got whatever the food tastes like to wow them with – you can't put that on Tumblr (at time of writing). As far as the intellectual property is concerned, I feel his pain, but he should take comfort from the fact that whoever first arranged a fry-up into the shape of a smiley face almost certainly never earned a penny from it.But what irritates me most about these chefs is that they're being so clever. They may come across as precious, but it won't make anyone think less of their cooking. On the contrary, by heavily implying that their food is beset by the greedy lenses of photographers – that it looks so good it gets papped and is forced to shun the limelight like Garbo – its deliciousness is taken as read. This is a problem, we all assume, only suffered by the best restaurants, the big chefs. At a Little Chef, it's not an issue – largely because they already provide photographs of the meals on the menus.ChefsFood & drinkSocial mediaFranceFacebookPhotographyTwitterDavid Mitchelltheguardian.com &copy; 2014 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.
